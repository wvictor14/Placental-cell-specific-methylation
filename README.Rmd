# README

For NIH EPIC cells project

R scripts and folders are named in the following system:

* Directories are numbered by the order their contained scripts in the workflow. For example, scripts
in `0_data` are ran before `1_qc_preprocess`, which is before `2_analysis.`
* Scripts are numbered by their directory and workflow order as well. `0_1_load_data.Rmd` is in the 
`0_data` directory and is ran before `0_2_check_data.Rmd.`
* Output from scripts is stored in either `main/interim` or `main/processed`. Output is prefixed by the
same prefix of the script used to generate them. For example, `0_1_load_data.Rmd` produces 
`0_1_rgset.rds`, which is stored in `main/interim`.
