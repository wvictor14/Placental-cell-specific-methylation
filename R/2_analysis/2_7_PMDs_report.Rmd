# Summary

This report describes the results of an analysis of PMD regions using placental cell DNAm data.

The main point here is that I'm having difficulties seeing clear definition of PMDs in our data, where PMDs are regions of intermediate/low methylation lying within surrounding regions of high methylation.

## Some background

Placental PMDs were original discovered using MethylC sequencing over the entire genome:

Let's take note of the scales of the plots 1A and 1D. They are 15 - 30 mega-bp long. Second thing 


I took the list of PMDs and annotated cpgs on the EPIC array.
